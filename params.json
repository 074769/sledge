It is written in .NET and uses OpenGL as a rendering platform.\r\n\r\nCurrently Sledge is a collection of source code components with limited support for actual mapping. A number of file format parsers are currently available, including FGD, RMF, VMF, MDL (limited support), and WAD (via [HLLib][1]).\r\n\r\nWhile progress is slow, I have every intention of continuing work on this project. The current focus is on Goldsource support.\r\n\r\nThe Sledge Editor is GPL. All other components are LGPL.\r\n\r\n[1]: http://nemesis.thewavelength.net/index.php?p=35","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
