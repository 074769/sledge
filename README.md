Sledge
======

*Please note: Sledge is not ready to be used for mapping!*

Sledge is an open source alternative to Valve's Hammer Editor for the Goldsource and Source engines. It is written in .NET and uses OpenGL as a rendering platform.

Currently Sledge is a collection of source code components with limited support for actual mapping. A number of file format parsers are currently available, including FGD, RMF, VMF, MDL (limited support), and WAD (via [HLLib][1]).

While progress is slow, I have every intention of continuing work on this project. The current focus is on Goldsource support.

The Sledge Editor is GPL. All other components are LGPL.
