                    <h3>Sledge Public Alpha</h3>
                    <p>Sledge is currently in alpha stage, so it may be unstable and some features are missing. Missing features include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Support for opening multiple maps at once</li>
                        <li>Advanced compile options</li>
                        <li>Rendering models</li>
                        <li>Autosaving</li>
                        <li>Support for PAK/GCF packaged installs</li>
                        <li>Built-in support for prefabs/instances</li>
                        <li>Automatic detection of game configurations</li>
                        <li>Transparent tool brush rendering</li>
                        <li>Support for editor cameras</li>

                <div class="span4">
                    <h3>Source Support</h3>
                    <p>The current milestone is to fully support Goldsource editing. Once the alpha test is complete, work to add support for Source will begin. Full Source support is expected to be released in version 2.</p>
                    <p>Many Source editing features will be available in Goldsource as well, such as displacements and instances. These features will convert to Goldsource-compatible brushwork when a map is compiled.</p>

                <div class="span4">
                    <h3>Future Possibilities</h3>
                    <p>Because Sledge is open source, the possibilities for future expansion are endless. Some popular ideas include the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Collaborative editing and multi-user support</li>
                        <li>A plugin system and support for scripting</li>
                        <li>Built-in support for version control systems like SVN and Git</li>
                        <li>Powerful displacement editing tools</li>
                        <li>A complete 'Sledge SDK' containing other editing and creation tools based on the Sledge code base</li>
                        <li>...and anything else you can think of!</li>
